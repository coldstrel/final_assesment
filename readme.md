# End of course

For this last module and last derivable I will talk about my team and myself about how we developed this last project.

## Self assesment
For developing this project I needed to make a research on how the cyptocurrencies work and how the investments are managed, I haven't studied or made a research before this so I was completely new into this. 

First it was the importance to understand how investments into cryptocurrencies work, we choosed BITCOIN because is the most popular, after a research I started working into our project, giving ideas and creating a plan on how to develop this project.
I also helped my team giving new ideas or complementing thei own.

I can say that I learned a lot from this experience and it was a great time working with my team and learning a lot of new things that I had never studied before. 

## Team assesment
As a team I can say we worked almost perfectly, we all give some ideas and work into the project, we had some meetings via ZOOM were we discused how to solve some of the problems we encountered during this project, it was a good experience and also we could meet each other and make firends, this way it was easier to present the project and get some of the problems solved.

## Summary
Our project were designed to tell us if it is a good idea to invest into some BITCOINS, wether we sell, buy or stand to make a profit of this type of investments. Also we made the project a way it can be accurate and let us invest without taking a lot of risks.
